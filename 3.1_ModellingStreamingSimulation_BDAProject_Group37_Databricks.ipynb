I tried them on RJ45 ports of different devices, my laptop, desktop, ethernet switches, etc. Most of the time they did not fit snug into the connector. when I shook the unit or tilted it downwards, some dust caps fell off. Since inner dimensions of RK45 connectors can slightly vary, a plastic dust cap is not a good choice, silicone rubber would be better. Even when a cap did not fall off when I shook or tilted a device, the one I plugged into my laptop fell off at the slightest brushing against it (like while carrying it around) Also these are too expensive for plastic parts. (I bought silicone dust caps for USB ports for a much lower price).<br />Next time I would go for soft rubber dust caps.<br />These do have one nice feature that is a  knob that makes it very easy to hold them and plug-in or pull-off.

Unfortunately, the \"key ring\" part of this drive is in a really awkward location instead of being on the top.  I could live with that, but one thing I can't live with is that the  key ring hole is seriously TINY.  I put it on the smallest key ring I personally own, and not only did it get stuck where the ends come together (the thinnest part of the key ring) the plastic housing began to DEFORM just from putting it on the ring.  I don't know why, but I thought the housing was metal.  It is not.  It's cheap plastic.  3 stars because it's really fast (350mb+ read and 120mb+ write) but it does not suit my needs.  If only the hole were bigger and made of metal this would be close to the perfect drive.  If you don't plan on putting this drive on a key ring, it's a killer deal.</td><td>B0BPZFW1JH</td><td>AF7YZQLXNYKERXP3JJLGDUEWJSZQ</td><td>3</td><td>1649367380441</td><td>2022-04-07 21:36:20</td><td>2022</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>791286</td><td>4</td><td>Durable Very durable once it is on.

Only 1 thing I'd change, otherwise great product! The only complaint I have (which is a very minor one) is that the company Acuvar wrote their name on the product in a raised way. So it rises above the product instead of just being printed on the product. The issue this causes is that when you go to stick on the white square it causes bumps that would make it somewhat hard to write on. This is only on one square per 12 count, so it's not a huge deal but definitely something you should take into consideration when buying this product. Other than that, great product!

Because I bought it as a gift and we just now opened it, the return window is closed, so we are stuck with this damaged Kindle. Very dissapointing.</td><td>B09V8F3P91</td><td>AE3BX5DAUIJW42UKX4LXMXQAFBDA</td><td>2</td><td>1671726598229</td><td>2022-12-22 16:29:58</td><td>2022</td><td>12</td><td>22</td><td>5</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>867725</td><td>5</td><td>Fantastic hard cover!!

I originally used an ultra high speed cable that worked okay, but I had little hiccups when using my soundbar,tv, and ATV4K and I mean little pauses,disconnects etc.My tv is a Sony A90J,my soundbar is Sony A7000 and an atv that I bought this winter.I connect my ATV through my soundbar as it’s capable of pass through for HDR and Vision. Apple apparently uses this particular cable for their testing and that’s the only reason why I purchased a $30 cable, but I’m extremely happy as my internal tv streaming was slowing down and the ATV was blazingly fast,along with improving picture quality and better audio.Make sure you have or can borrow a iPhone to set the ATV up at first.Anyway,the cable has been truly amazing and I’d say I’ve had NO MORE HANDSHAKE ISSUES. If you’re hesitant to pay $30 for a cable that normally costs $10(I was too)at least give it a shot.If you’re not having any problems with your current cable, then obviously keep it, but if you’re experiencing problems as I was,or especially if you’re going to be using a soundbar(or HomePods)having a tv with earc is a big deal, but not absolutely necessary.If using the input as I do with the soundbar,first make sure that your soundbar is capable of pass through for hdr,Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos,etc, and BUY THIS ASAP. I’m totally one of those people who doesn’t waste money on equipment that won’t make a difference. BASICALLY,all hdmi cables are the same,depending on your exact needs. I would say when using a 2.1 port with a 2.0 cable which people do,everything else will have trouble.Now I started using a cheap certified ultra high speed cable that didn’t click for some reason (maybe just an Apple thing?) as it should have.It was 48gbps which is important, but the Belkin Ultra High Speed Certified cable with Dolby Vision has just been amazing. No more issues,which when running many devices,IS A GREAT THING! Don’t listen to people who say it’s a scam,especially when running an ATV4K.

My issue is I would run teams on both computers, but I would only have my voice and video on one, and be presenting on the other, and I would have to wait a few seconds to mute or unmute between switching over my mouse and keyboard as there is a 3-5 second switch while the computer redetects the mouse and keyboard every time.<br /><br />Now I just have a mute button plugged directly into my computer with my mic, and I can press it to mute or unmute no matter which computer I am connected to.

It also works flawlessly in Teams whether the app is open, docked, or in the background. You can use ctrl+shift+M to mute in teams, but it has to be the active program.

The PC is almost dead silent under normal work load like browsing internet, light gaming, etc. (this PC has a AMD 4700G APU). The case still has a little bit of noise on high load, but I think it's the power supply fan.

It'd easily be a 4/5, or maybe even a 5/5 if I was taking budget into heavy consideration, if XMP worked. Even in the latest BIOS revision, attempting memory speed above 3000 causes instability and BSOD. Doing some research on builders subreddits and it seems I'm not the only one to have this particular issue with this board, its just a known thing that people are waiting on a BIOS update for. Until then, if you have memory that's clocked above 3000 with XMP, you won't be able to get that speed without adding a lot of system instability. Once a BIOS update comes down I will probably update my review, but for now I would look for something else if you're building and you intend to use XMP memory profiles.</td><td>B0BL2X6FPM</td><td>AFQA4QZN5ZTGEVF5L2T4IKAXJSAQ</td><td>6</td><td>1648695124348</td><td>2022-03-31 02:52:04</td><td>2022</td><td>3</td><td>31</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>565037</td><td>5</td><td>Great case for iPad pro used for inventories Easy to install great convince for holding the iPad to complete the inventories.

It appeared to transfer the files normally the first time. However, when I tried to open some of my photos and videos my files said that the software was unable to open them. When I checked the file properties the storage for each induvial file I was unable to open it said that the file was 0 MB. Only a small minority of the files (about 30 GB) both showed up and opened normally. Now I know what you're thinking \"How do you know that your files are not corrupted and that the problem is not on your end?\". Well simple enough. I copied those same files from my other external hard drive to my computer and additionally to another USB and guess what? They opened instantly and without lag when booting from my other external and my computer itself. The only time the files had any trouble was after they had been transferred to this SD card. For further proof I used a software called H2testw to test the device by having the software load data to the card and then testing to see if the card was functional or not. The test results were as follows \"This media device is likely defective. 30.7 GB okay.\" The rest was labeled lost. This card stopped transferring data after its 30.7 GB were filled. The rest of the files had the labels they started out with but were completely void of data. Now maybe I just got one of the few defective devices. That said people should buy with caution. They say you pay for what you get and that if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. I recommended forking over a few more dollars and getting a trusted name brand over this card. It may have been cheap but I received a faulty device. I know that at least I will stick to name brands from now on. Wish the rest of you luck! If yours does work please leave a review! I would love to know if it was just my card that was bad.

The replacement was terrible and not worth the $70.  After using this keyboard for a couple of months now, I would give it mixed reviews.  I have to continuously deactivate the 2nd key to the right of the space bar as it is too touchy for words and makes my iPad do weird stuff.  It does not pair quickly when I open my device up.  The worst part of it is that it does not hold a charge long enough.  I do not type on it for hours on end, only sporadically.  But I have to charge it almost every day at some point.

I have been using this power supply to test some old existing 120mm PC case fans and some new case fans as well for a new PC workstation rig I am building, so I needed a splitter in order to test the fans since most most fans these days are 3 or 4-pin PWM.<br /><br />One end of the splitter connects beautifully with a snug connection to the power supply's molex connectors and the other end for up to 3 fans.

It works best for watching movies or TV shows, but is wonderful for a good jam-out session or playing a PC game without any loss of sound.<br />I would definitely purchase this speaker for family or friends that are on the road a lot, use their laptops frequently, or just as an all-around versatile gift.

The actual USB-C plug is not entirely aligned with the hub. To put it differently, when the hub is sitting flat, the wire and USB-C plug do not have the same orientation, rather, the plug is almost slanted or perpendicular to the body. It has not caused any performance issues, but I do have to bend it a bit more to be able to utilize the features. I just hope longterm this will not cause bending issues with the wires.

So it didn't make sense to splurge on a new, already outdated model.<br /><br />Given my power requirement needs, I don't need a 1000W unit with a 7800x3D and a 4080.  Tests show that the max draw for that combo is around 400-450 watts which is the sweet spot for an 850W unit.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I've bought this same model (Seasonic Focus PX-850W) several years ago for my intel build.

Also, when not used for longer periods, just touching any key did not wake it up consistently. And now I'm not talking about just the backlight functionality, but the keyboard functionality.

The card itself though older I think must have sat on a shelf somewhere. It has extremely good reviews and lived up to it's reputation. Am getting 115 FPS on some games matched with an AMD G5600 cpu and Asus mother board. Perfect operation and runs very cool at 300 mhz with standard non gaming operation. Handled it's 1400mhz output just great at 60 degrees Celsius.  AMD's new adrenalin software is great and functions perfectly.

The color is chic with the grey and gold combo (and matched the photo description) and the large pocket can easily fit my laptop charger and mouse. However, after my first use of a few hours, I noticed a large amount of 'dust' on my keyboard. It's definitely coming from the fur interior of the sleeve. I don't know the long-term effects of having this dust buildup seeping into the keyboard, so unfortunately I will have to find a new carrying case to use.</td><td>B09WYYFQ9L</td><td>AF4VTQNMKQI2DLHECDBYYAOLTWDA</td><td>0</td><td>1685997653409</td><td>2023-06-05 20:40:53</td><td>2023</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>968476</td><td>5</td><td>Perfect case This is the perfect iPad case, strong and sturdy.

Too often portable monitors come with somewhat average sized cables making them too thick or rigid for comfortable portable use. The included cable is similar to a Monoprice slim HDMI cable.<br />* Sound is pretty decent for a portable monitor. I have had several small / portable HDMI screens with speakers over the years and this might be the best sounding. Won't blow you away but good in a pinch.<br />* VESA mounting. I prefer to use more, smaller monitors to large traditional monitors for my desktop setup. The ability to mount it even though it has a flexible builtin base is great. However... see below.<br /><br />Minor grips include:<br />* The build quality and how it is represented in the images. The images make it appear metal with beveled corners but it is all plastic. While it helps with weight it does feel more fragile and flimsy when compared to similarly sized metal portable monitors.<br />* The bottom of the monitor where the largest bezel is located is a very thin plastic. Grabbing the monitor there you immediately feel it press into the frame and even a light touch leads to the screen receiving pressure.<br />* VESA mounting is a bit odd. 1) They are using 100mm spacing for the mounting holes rather than the more standard 75mm found in small and light monitors. In my case this turned out to be a slight positive due to my setup but most of the other small monitors I have are using 75mm spacing. 2) They are using non-standard M3 screw sizes. M4 is the norm and as a result I had to search through jars of random screws I have to find ones that would fit. I can understand why they don't include the screws in the box but it certainly would have been nice given they aren't even standard sizes for VESA mounts.<br />* The brightness appears to reset after losing power. I was told it could be due to insufficient power delivery.

Normally use larger laptop backpacks as can carry more items, but a larger size means either the overhead bin or checked.  This backpack qualifies as an Underseat personal item for most airlines as can pack three days worth of clothes - plus something flat in the rear pocket - and dimensions remain under the 18x14x8 limit.  Obviously if ALL pockets were used simultaneously the material would expand beyond 8 inches, but with care it should fit under the average airline seat.  Only negative is that the main compartment unzips halfway rather than flipping open completely for potential inspections.  Guess the trick would be to pack any Questionable Items - liquids, tweezers, etc - in the TOP half of the bag to make them accessible during security screenings.  And can always cover the logo with black electrical or duct tape.<br /><br />Don't have time for detailed measurements, but it slid into my test box so it's less than 18x14x8 and Good Enough.  For a bit of a size comparison, was able to place three 11x5 paper towel rolls in the main compartment plus a 12x9x.5 box in the rear compartment.  Have seen other products where backpack straps could be completely concealed with a zipper, but straps still count as depth and can live without additional zippers so long as the bag fits.  For what it is worth, also found a personal item suitcase that holds FIVE paper towel rolls instead of three since rigid plastic does not stretch the way cloth does, but this backpack can be used once one gets off the plane while luggage is best left at the hotel.<br /><br />FYI:  The selling page shows the backpack as smooth an unwrinkled while the product itself is actually a little rumpled, but this is great as it doesn't look like there's a briefcase strapped to my back.</td><td>B0B76WV33B</td><td>AH63LE3J753QTQM2V6PQMZXQRIHQ</td><td>2</td><td>1672481275609</td><td>2022-12-31 10:07:55</td><td>2022</td><td>12</td><td>31</td><td>7</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>408288</td><td>5</td><td>Fantastic Super easy to install!

Yes, the 2021 12.9 iPad Pro fits!… albeit, very, very tightly. So, I’m going to add some cushiony tape around the edges to help compensate in case of a drop. But more than worth the risk due to this simple fact: it is THE best keyboard/cover design around!<br /><br />The way the keyboard attaches at a slight incline, exactly how Microsoft designed the Surface Pro keyboards — along with the perfect snap into place that happens automagically via magnets… it is PERFECT… though, technically, that incline is less healthy for your wrists if you’re seated at a table; but I’m typically reclined in bed when I’m using it, so it’s appreciated! AND you could always detach it and use it completely flat — being bluetooth, it doesn’t need to be attached to work.<br /><br />ALSO — they have NAILED the stand with this model (and taken a clumsy step back with its replacement) — no unstable kickstand to bite into your legs; instead, you have this very sturdy-feeling foot that folds down, providing MUCH more surface area for much greater support.<br /><br />The keys are snappy, feel great to type on. Appreciate the backlighting as well. Another thing that’s apparent after using the 11-in iPad with the Zagg SlimBook Go (which led me to buying this model) — the 12.9 size is noticeably more comfortable in width. Just FYI for anyone on the fence between the two.<br /><br />The detachable cover (always a great feature), despite being a couple of millimeters too small to TRULY fit my 2021 PERFECTLY (and again, it’s not meant to), is an excellent design, with a perfectly functional pencil slot — and the fact the stand is ATTACHED TO THE COVER and travels with it, providing that functionality without the keyboard, is a no-brainer of a design decision that many other keyboard-cover combos are missing.<br /><br />Well done, whoever at Zagg was responsible for creating this masterpiece — so well done, I’m choosing it over newer models meant to replace it!<br /><br />ZAGG — reassess your design decisions, and update this genius design for current and future iPad models, please!!</td><td>B08J6L945R</td><td>AELMS7J6L76PJABFE7JEUHCE22NQ</td><td>1</td><td>1658782745755</td><td>2022-07-25 20:59:05</td><td>2022</td><td>7</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>805802</td><td>1</td><td>Don’t know Don’t know</td><td>B09RB67TXC</td><td>AFSS5AGY5DONRARG57LB56GVH5EQ</td><td>0</td><td>1673841203381</td><td>2023-01-16 03:53:23</td><td>2023</td><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>657137</td><td>4</td><td>Good Value Git the size of storage I was looking for along with a 2-pack; filled my needs to a tee.</td><td>B09LYY548P</td><td>AFJHGELTMBPETIOKBCUBEE67AQ7Q</td><td>1</td><td>1668037120015</td><td>2022-11-09 23:38:40</td><td>2022</td><td>11</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>124330</td><td>5</td><td>Love this for work!

They were great, and we still had 50 days of warranty on the unit, so a replacement was sent quickly. I registered the product on Lenovo's site with the Dock serial number to extend the warranty to the full three years. Lenovo contacted me and stated, \"This serial number is rooted in Singapore, and the country of the invoice you provided as proof of purchase is the United States of America. For us to update warranty dates, the country of manufacture and the country of the invoice must match.\" So product sold to other areas of the world is being sold to US customers and should not be! Buyer beware. Luckily for us, there were still 50 days on the warranty, and Lenovo sent a replacement. You can find out the remaining warranty if you register the dock on Lenovo's site.

This case will not obstruct your camera in any way, it is still easy to access all the ports for charging and headphones. The main case is composed of three layers that are very secure. It can be kind of hard to put together if you don't know what you're doing. I would suggest that the company put a video of how to put it together, but you should be able to figure it out after a few tries. First put on the hard back the tablet should settle into it.

As soon as I updated the firmware and tweaked the settings my speeds dropped to barely 2000MBs in all modes, slower than the original nvme I had.

This is a very attractive case for a budget build, and I don't hate it.  I really like that it comes with card readers on the front i/o for both SD and Micro SD even though they take up an extra USB port on the motherboard on top of the extra USB port you need for the USB 2.0 slots that they conveniently added right beside the 1 USB 3.0 slot that needs its own dedicated port.<br /><br />Cable management is a pain.  There's just not enough room behind the right side panel to stow your power cables without making an absolute mess even with a fully modular PSU.  The 3.5 inch drive ports are right behind the power supply port which makes it even worse, and there is no way to remove them without cutting them out.<br /><br />The metal is cheap.  I had a problem plugging my power cable into my SATA SSD due to the metal flange protruding a good half inch below the dedicated mounting location, so I just bent it out of the way with my thumb.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this case is ventilation.  There's about a half inch air gap at the bottom of the front panel which is suppose to feed the front intake fans (not included).  There are two vents on the bottom, one for the PSU and one for the 3.5\" drive bays, but they are both blocked off from the rest of the case by the unremoveable PSU compartment cover, and since I had to run my cables through the drive bays, that one doesn't do much good anyway.  There is one 120 mm vent directly above the CPU with no screw holes to mount a fan.  The air that comes in through that hole is sucked straight back out by the rear 80 mm fan which is included, so it just bypasses all of the hot spots.  The GPU is limited to what air it can pull in from the PCIe ports, so it will just boil and die without some alternate cooling solution, and there's no good way to mount a liquid cooler of any size despite the claims made in the description.<br /><br />All-in-all, this would make a very attractive, low wattage, office dektop, but if you are looking to build a halfway decent gaming PC, look elsewhere unless you just like the convenience of cooking your frozen burritos directly on top of your graphics card.</td><td>B08SM7PMS8</td><td>AEAOOCCJFKZTW7U6P4JMT3WQH5AQ</td><td>2</td><td>1663513554624</td><td>2022-09-18 15:05:54</td><td>2022</td><td>9</td><td>18</td><td>1</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>68625</td><td>5</td><td>good product good product and easy install</td><td>B09XWXHRJP</td><td>AH5ZWCSOWRQF4F5CQJV7MUCDGQKQ</td><td>0</td><td>1643415441309</td><td>2022-01-29 00:17:21</td><td>2022</td><td>1</td><td>29</td><td>7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>831461</td><td>5</td><td>Great buy!

I would have loved to have given this purchase 5/5 stars, but there is one big issue...  Synology's own Knowledge Base/Tutorials are crap, and setting this thing up is NOT intuitive in any measure - not if you want it secure, operating at peak efficiency, and performing everything you need it to.<br /><br />Practically everything I needed to setup - PLEX, Synology Photos, or whatever, was a chore.  Sure, somethings were quite easy to setup, but most things weren't due to lack of information inside the apps, the UI, or Synology's own KB.  I had to resort to watching YouTube videos due to a lack of information from Synology, but more frustrating - a lack of intuitive controls.  I highly urge you to view the videos by SpaceRex, who has an entire series of videos that will prove very helpful - you'll even learn about stuff you were unaware of.<br /><br />Now that I do have it setup the way I want, I'm amazed at all of the options open to me.  I was simply thinking of this as a network storage device that could also serve as my PLEX server and store miscellaneous files.  That alone should have told me that it could act as a server for pretty much anything else.<br /><br />So, am I happy with this purchase - yep, but just a bit frustrated at Synology's own lack of guidance.  I see this as more of an engineer who wrote the help files without letting a non-engineer reinterpret them for normal users scenario - and I'm familiar with setting up servers.  You could argue it is just getting to know the UI, but again, a lot of things simply weren't intuitive...<br /><br />My only other issue...I now wish I'd purchased a 4 bay enclosure to being with.</td><td>B087Z6SNC1</td><td>AFNCIJY4QVS224TQ6OFCPSJFXQNQ</td><td>5</td><td>1675137119146</td><td>2023-01-31 03:51:59</td><td>2023</td><td>1</td><td>31</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>419018</td><td>5</td><td>Sweet case!

We use it to do work and play games.I would recommend it to those looking for something to use as a second screen.The reason I went ahead and got this monitor was because it has good reviews and they where not wrong it works good just what i needed and was looking for.",

When I tried using a second USB-C cable it would not work. I contacted customer support and they quickly explained the issue. They then sent me a spare cable for free. This is excellent customer service. I highly recommend this monitor!!!!!",

These turned out to be plastic parts. I tried them on RJ45 ports of different devices, my laptop, desktop, ethernet switches, etc. Most of the time they did not fit snug into the connector. when I shook the unit or tilted it downwards, some dust caps fell off. Since inner dimensions of RK45 connectors can slightly vary, a plastic dust cap is not a good choice, silicone rubber would be better. Even when a cap did not fall off when I shook or tilted a device, the one I plugged into my laptop fell off at the slightest brushing against it (like while carrying it around) Also these are too expensive for plastic parts. (I bought silicone dust caps for USB ports for a much lower price).<br />Next time I would go for soft rubber dust caps.<br />These do have one nice feature that is a  knob that makes it very easy to hold them and plug-in or pull-off. (Some other products have no such knob and it can be difficult to pull off the dust cover because there is nothing to grip and pull)",

It just won't work. Amazon is sending me a replacement, but now I'm worried this thing won't last even if the new one will turn on. Also, the screen cover is annoying to use as the flaps keep getting in the way.<br /><br />I'll update this review when the replacement comes.<br /><br />UPDATE (11.22.22):<br /><br />I got the replacement today and the monitor turned on (after a couple tries). It's solid and I like that you can use a single USB-C cable. Keep in mind, however, that the built-in speaker volume is limited to 35/100 if you connect the USB-C cable directly to your laptop without using the included power brick & HDMI.<br /><br />At certain angles there is a reddish color bleed visible under text displayed on the screen, but it's a common issue I've seen on other OLED laptop screens.<br /><br />The bottom line is it's probably the best portable 15\" monitor that has a foldable stand right now.",

         "Fast, But Could Be Built Better I have been using Kingston traveler aluminum key ring drives for years now, but wanted to give this Samsung drive a shot because it was on sale and 256GB is plenty of storage for me.  Unfortunately, the \"key ring\" part of this drive is in a really awkward location instead of being on the top.  I could live with that, but one thing I can't live with is that the  key ring hole is seriously TINY.  I put it on the smallest key ring I personally own, and not only did it get stuck where the ends come together (the thinnest part of the key ring) the plastic housing began to DEFORM just from putting it on the ring.  I don't know why, but I thought the housing was metal.  It is not.  It's cheap plastic.  3 stars because it's really fast (350mb+ read and 120mb+ write) but it does not suit my needs.  If only the hole were bigger and made of metal this would be close to the perfect drive.  If you don't plan on putting this drive on a key ring, it's a killer deal.",

The install was very straightforward, as the drivers were essentially automatically installed. It's very \"plug and play\" and for the price I really couldn't ask for much more.

First, that burns electricity, and second it's more demanding of the little electric motors in a conventional hard drive. I had one fail at a very inopportune time recently, so I thought I would give these a try. So far, great... We'll see if they still work a few years from now, but in my mind they should be more reliable long term.

The only complaint I have (which is a very minor one) is that the company Acuvar wrote their name on the product in a raised way. So it rises above the product instead of just being printed on the product. The issue this causes is that when you go to stick on the white square it causes bumps that would make it somewhat hard to write on. This is only on one square per 12 count, so it's not a huge deal but definitely something you should take into consideration when buying this product. Other than that, great product! Haven't used it long term, but I like that it's more compact than a regular memory card case! If I come across any issues, I'll try to update this review! Best bang for your buck and it's compact!",

The resolution is still good; and I have not had any issues with the monitor at all.<br /><br />I do wish however, that it had an ADDITIONAL HDMI input. There is only ONE HDMI input, so if you have two HDMI items, such as a switch and computer you want to hook up to the monitor, you will have to be a HDMI 2 to 1 adapter to go with your monitor. Which I had to do, and it was like $20.<br /><br />Good Monitor for this average computer user and mild Switch Gamer.",

I read great advice that keep it plugged in if you want the keyboard lights to stay on. Great tip! I also will get some legs to lift the back up. The keyboard is solid for sure and types awesome. The lighting is perfect behind the keys. I am a touch typer but just makes it easier more comfortable to be able to see the keys. The set up was easy as well. I literally got this 1 hr ago and was so excited couldn't wait to review. I will update down the line if need be. Definately recommend and money well spent.",

         "Best for ATV4K#2. I originally used an ultra high speed cable that worked okay, but I had little hiccups when using my soundbar,tv, and ATV4K and I mean little pauses,disconnects etc.My tv is a Sony A90J,my soundbar is Sony A7000 and an atv that I bought this winter.I connect my ATV through my soundbar as it’s capable of pass through for HDR and Vision. Apple apparently uses this particular cable for their testing and that’s the only reason why I purchased a $30 cable, but I’m extremely happy as my internal tv streaming was slowing down and the ATV was blazingly fast,along with improving picture quality and better audio.Make sure you have or can borrow a iPhone to set the ATV up at first.Anyway,the cable has been truly amazing and I’d say I’ve had NO MORE HANDSHAKE ISSUES. If you’re hesitant to pay $30 for a cable that normally costs $10(I was too)at least give it a shot.If you’re not having any problems with your current cable, then obviously keep it, but if you’re experiencing problems as I was,or especially if you’re going to be using a soundbar(or HomePods)having a tv with earc is a big deal, but not absolutely necessary.If using the input as I do with the soundbar,first make sure that your soundbar is capable of pass through for hdr,Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos,etc, and BUY THIS ASAP. I’m totally one of those people who doesn’t waste money on equipment that won’t make a difference. BASICALLY,all hdmi cables are the same,depending on your exact needs. I would say when using a 2.1 port with a 2.0 cable which people do,everything else will have trouble.Now I started using a cheap certified ultra high speed cable that didn’t click for some reason (maybe just an Apple thing?) as it should have.It was 48gbps which is important, but the Belkin Ultra High Speed Certified cable with Dolby Vision has just been amazing. No more issues,which when running many devices,IS A GREAT THING! Don’t listen to people who say it’s a scam,especially when running an ATV4K. GREAT HDMI CABLE,thanks Belkin.",

First off these are not nearly as loud as i thought they would be after reading so many comments about noise on the X16s granted these are X18s but i did not read anything saying they were quieter. i have mine in a 4 bay enclosure sitting on my desk and i have to stick my ear directly on the enclosure to hear the drive when its writing,i was expecting a clanky sounding drive like the good old days but this thing is near silent in my enclosure,maybe i just lucky who knows..ether way i will be grabbing more of these my write speeds are about 250Mbs for smaller files and i was getting about 210Mbs sustained transferring 9 TB to the drive, i like these drives better then WB black drives witch i do love but get hot as hell after a long write. this thing after 8 hours of writing in that little enclosure was still only 34c if that had of been one of my black drives i would have been able to cook eggs on it. if you worried about one of these drives because of noise levels then dont worry unless you are super sensitive or have bionic hearing. i mean im in my 40s so im sure my hearing could be better but i can hear my ceiling fan over this thing. performance on these drives blew me away i was not expecting that from them if you need large storage then you found a winner here and cost less then most of the other enterprise drives.",

I run 2 separate computers with 2 separate monitors that are hooked up to a switch for my mouse and keyboard. My issue is I would run teams on both computers, but I would only have my voice and video on one, and be presenting on the other, and I would have to wait a few seconds to mute or unmute between switching over my mouse and keyboard as there is a 3-5 second switch while the computer redetects the mouse and keyboard every time.<br /><br />Now I just have a mute button plugged directly into my computer with my mic, and I can press it to mute or unmute no matter which computer I am connected to. For the money I could've easily bought another keyboard, and mouse, but I already have them, and I simply don't have the space for them.<br /><br />The button is nice as it gives you the option to customize the light colors to let you know if you're muted or not. It also works flawlessly in Teams whether the app is open, docked, or in the background. You can use ctrl+shift+M to mute in teams, but it has to be the active program. You can also set it up for push to talk if you like that more, or are in a noisier environment.<br /><br />I am happy with it, but I also feel like this could easily be made with some free software, and a much cheaper $10 usb button without all the options, and I'd be just as happy.",

Also, the spread difficulty of GCE is the same as KE, so they seem to be made similar.  These are clearly to the best pastes on the market, I just need to get used to and figure out the best spreading method since these pastes are more \"gummy\" like in consistency.

I bought 2 of these 80mm 4 pin fans and replaced the CPU and rear case fans. Although Noctua doesn't officially support Lenovo, they worked. I installed them and ran Prime95 for 30 minutes and didn't get any overheating errors. The PC is almost dead silent under normal work load like browsing internet, light gaming, etc. (this PC has a AMD 4700G APU). The case still has a little bit of noise on high load, but I think it's the power supply fan. I may take it apart and see if I can replace that power supply fan with a Noctua fan as well in the future, but so far it's a big improvement for little cost.",

It'd easily be a 4/5, or maybe even a 5/5 if I was taking budget into heavy consideration, if XMP worked. Even in the latest BIOS revision, attempting memory speed above 3000 causes instability and BSOD. Doing some research on builders subreddits and it seems I'm not the only one to have this particular issue with this board, its just a known thing that people are waiting on a BIOS update for. Until then, if you have memory that's clocked above 3000 with XMP, you won't be able to get that speed without adding a lot of system instability. Once a BIOS update comes down I will probably update my review, but for now I would look for something else if you're building and you intend to use XMP memory profiles.",

         "Storage Space Is Either Corrupt or Simply Mislabeled I originally tried saving about 209 GB to the card. It appeared to transfer the files normally the first time. However, when I tried to open some of my photos and videos my files said that the software was unable to open them. When I checked the file properties the storage for each induvial file I was unable to open it said that the file was 0 MB. Only a small minority of the files (about 30 GB) both showed up and opened normally. Now I know what you're thinking \"How do you know that your files are not corrupted and that the problem is not on your end?\". Well simple enough. I copied those same files from my other external hard drive to my computer and additionally to another USB and guess what? They opened instantly and without lag when booting from my other external and my computer itself. The only time the files had any trouble was after they had been transferred to this SD card. For further proof I used a software called H2testw to test the device by having the software load data to the card and then testing to see if the card was functional or not. The test results were as follows \"This media device is likely defective. 30.7 GB okay.\" The rest was labeled lost. This card stopped transferring data after its 30.7 GB were filled. The rest of the files had the labels they started out with but were completely void of data. Now maybe I just got one of the few defective devices. That said people should buy with caution. They say you pay for what you get and that if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. I recommended forking over a few more dollars and getting a trusted name brand over this card. It may have been cheap but I received a faulty device. I know that at least I will stick to name brands from now on. Wish the rest of you luck! If yours does work please leave a review! I would love to know if it was just my card that was bad. Happy shopping!",

Apple customer service helped talk me through the setup (pretty simple). I'm was so nervous that I'd lose pics/videos. Everything went smoothly. It runs quietly and even matches my Mac. Happy!",

My previous netgear router wasn’t able to keep up with our demand at home with my wife and I working from home plus multiple other devices connecting to internet simultaneously. After lot of research I narrowed down on this model of Orbi and I have been very very pleased with the performance so far. It feels like our home internet has gone through a complete upgrade and makeover. No more connection drops, no more “no internet”, no more wifi completely disappeared.<br /><br />I have hardwire connected the base and the satellite to ensure no connection issues between them and the satellite is emitting strong signal.<br /><br />The app on my cell to setup, configure and maintain the routers is easy enough. But I am a techie…can’t say how a non-technical person would feel about it.<br /><br />I personally would highly recommend this router if you are facing slow performance with your current router.",

I recently purchased a 5th generation iPad Air and while it was difficult to find a keyboard which was compatible, this one is.  It was easy to set up.  On m old IPad Air 2,  I used a Belkin, which was wonderful.  When it finally died, I replaced it with a different brand as the Belkin was no longer being sold.  The replacement was terrible and not worth the $70.  After using this keyboard for a couple of months now, I would give it mixed reviews.  I have to continuously deactivate the 2nd key to the right of the space bar as it is too touchy for words and makes my iPad do weird stuff.  It does not pair quickly when I open my device up.  The worst part of it is that it does not hold a charge long enough.  I do not type on it for hours on end, only sporadically.  But I have to charge it almost every day at some point.  It should last longer than that.  It also takes hours (yes, HOURS) to charge.  I am not impressed and wish there were a better option.  I am looking.",

When I travel, I often bring my laptop with me for entertainment - however, it is sometimes hard to watch shows, movies, and play PC games and have adequate sound quality without using headphones.<br />I purchased this speaker because I have purchased items from this company in the past, and they have always provided the best quality.<br />The speaker is easy to set up with clear instructions - my computer can be particular about connecting to some speakers, but this one connected no problem - , and it charges quickly and holds a charge for over 3 hours (I have not had to use it for over that amount of time without a charge, but it does not even give me a \"low battery\" warning after 3 hours of use).<br />The sound quality is above average - the bass is a little lower, but I have bought speakers that are this price or slightly more expensive with worse sound quality. It works best for watching movies or TV shows, but is wonderful for a good jam-out session or playing a PC game without any loss of sound.<br />I would definitely purchase this speaker for family or friends that are on the road a lot, use their laptops frequently, or just as an all-around versatile gift. I have already recommended it to my family, and they are very pleased with this speaker.",

With its sleek design, compact size, and all of the adapters I need as a multimedia worker (SD,USB,HDMI), this is a must have tool that I use daily.<br /><br />However, there was one small design feature (or possibly mistake) that I was not the biggest fan of. The actual USB-C plug is not entirely aligned with the hub. To put it differently, when the hub is sitting flat, the wire and USB-C plug do not have the same orientation, rather, the plug is almost slanted or perpendicular to the body. It has not caused any performance issues, but I do have to bend it a bit more to be able to utilize the features. I just hope longterm this will not cause bending issues with the wires. So far, everything works great.",

         "Well designed, performance is a bit lacking I was pretty excited to get this multi tool of cables and adapters neatly organized in a little container. It's seems well put together, and doesn't feel flimsy at all. My issue is the performance is sub par, the card reader transfers at 2.0 speeds. I tested the usb c cable on other devices, and it transfers at 2.0 speeds. I tried higher quality cables, and the reader is also limited. If your intentions are only for charging, then this is a great little device, but I think it's priced a little to high for a sub par card reader. Even if you found a better usb C cable (the supplied one is quite thin) the USB A to C adapter is only 2.0 (4 pins). I didn't test the lighting adapter, but the micro adapter inherently is 2.0 by design as well",

I busted out with my fluke Ethernet DSX kit and I can honestly say I'm disappointed. I've always hard sided with the \"don't fall for the cat8 scam\" but for the first time I bought a few cat8 gold plated to get the look that I'm going for, and those blew these out of the water in every aspect. However, I still stand by these for their longevity and your every day get the job done aspect. I'm just disappointed with this particular product because of the latency. I would hope that they paid close attention to the shielding because the readings that I'm getting is that there is little to no copper.",

However, the PCI-SIG group is revising the 12VHPWR connector and every manufacturer already released their power supplies with the old revision. So it didn't make sense to splurge on a new, already outdated model.<br /><br />Given my power requirement needs, I don't need a 1000W unit with a 7800x3D and a 4080.  Tests show that the max draw for that combo is around 400-450 watts which is the sweet spot for an 850W unit.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I've bought this same model (Seasonic Focus PX-850W) several years ago for my intel build.

         "Connects fine, but doesn't remain backlit This keyboard easily connected and was quick to set up out of the box. The problem is that the backlight function times out in 30 seconds. This rendered the keyboard virtually useless to me as I need to be able to see it even after I haven't used it for a short time. Also, when not used for longer periods, just touching any key did not wake it up consistently. And now I'm not talking about just the backlight functionality, but the keyboard functionality. This usability design error renders this keyboard essentially useless to me. Others that don't have such issues may have a much better experience. I'm returning it even though I like the design and the key action. I need to be able to see it when I look down and this one is not it. The maker said they time out the backlight to save battery. They should give the user the option to choose. Also, fairly wide keyboard due to the keypad. Maybe offer another version without the keypad.",

DOS at least gave me the following error: Error in IOCTL call which, according to at least one online forum, it's \"toast.\" :(",

As long as you are a pretty responsible adult this should be enough protection. I wouldn't recommend this but I did put a 75lb weight vest on top of it in my computer chair. When I realized I did that my heart dropped. It turns out I just got lucky that day I'm sure it was a feather from being broken. Like I said I don't think it was 100% the case but the case and some luck.<br />Anyways this is a good bag to have. It has served me fine.<br /><br />The con of this bag is you cant put anything more than a 15.6 ince laptop and a charging cable in it.",

Nowadays us PC Builders are using plexi-glass and tempered-glass cases that show off everything, and Black cables are the prime choice for this. White cables might not be a bad idea since White builds are in style and people like Bitwit will pay a price premium for white hardware.<br /><br />I don't have nostalgic feeling towards red, pink, or bright blue cables..... and I'm glad these don't come with motherboards anymore.<br /><br />The thing is the Cable Matters 90 degree connector cables that I got are black.",

As others have stated the quality has gone way down, for the price (double other cases) you should get higher quality, they've cheapened the quality while charging same price.

Instructions were a bit vague when it came to attaching the gpu, riser, and bracket all together. Since I've seen reviews for a totally different bracket, I want to be clear: this bracket has the logo on top of the lightbar, which seems to be of different design compared to the ones with the ezdiyfab logo on the front of the lightbar. PROBABLY GOOD TO PLUG IN DISPLAY CABLES BEFORE YOU SEAT THE BRACKET IN YOUR CASE<br /><br />Pros: -adjustable support bracket -sturdy -adressable rgb works with aura sync -relatively easy install -looks great<br /><br />Cons: -can be a little tricky *patience* -'white' rgb doesn't get too white; you can see blues and purples amongst the LEDs so I had to kind of tune the RAM color to match its ice-bluish color which is still pretty cool",

When I opened it I was extremely happy. The card looked brand new. Not a blemish to be found, even had the port caps still on it. No dust or dirt. Backplate really shiny. I plugged the unit in. Both fans came on. It lit up and went straight to boot. The card itself though older I think must have sat on a shelf somewhere. It has extremely good reviews and lived up to it's reputation. Am getting 115 FPS on some games matched with an AMD G5600 cpu and Asus mother board. Perfect operation and runs very cool at 300 mhz with standard non gaming operation. Handled it's 1400mhz output just great at 60 degrees Celsius.  AMD's new adrenalin software is great and functions perfectly. The company NexusPCs that sold me this card gets 10 stars for a perfect used product. Thanks Guys!. You made an old gamer VERY HAPPY!.",

It unfortunately got in the way of my 7-in-1 USB C hub and I was surprised to find a lack of products in the market to solve this issue. I chose this product over 2 individual USB C male to female extenders because it was more stable, especially when the hub uses 2 outlets instead of just 1. Both does its job, however the Afterplug just seems like the better choice just from stability and durability alone. I also noticed a little more overheating of my hub when using the 2 separate extenders.",

Maybe that’s wishful thinking, but this board gave me what I needed to do that: ddr5 slots with full xmp support (I’m running 32gb @5600Mhz), 2x Pcie 5.0 slots, and scads of room for m.2 drives (the heat sink is fantastic, too!).

         "Great I purchased this after looking alternatives more expensive models and makes twice the price but thought Id  take a cahance on this sleek looking cheaper alternative knowing I could return it if it didnt do the job. My router is on the level above in the kitchen / Condo, and I work in the garage below. Comapred to the previous usb wifi stick this is just amazing giving a full solid 200 mps. Performance and looks 10/10. Also love the fact its on its own base plate with and rather than having stuck into a usb port directly I can place it anywhere due to the generous supplied cable. You simply can not go wrong with this plug and play cost effective item.. Best I have used and great low ping  1ms for gaming despite being in the garage..",

The color is chic with the grey and gold combo (and matched the photo description) and the large pocket can easily fit my laptop charger and mouse. However, after my first use of a few hours, I noticed a large amount of 'dust' on my keyboard. It's definitely coming from the fur interior of the sleeve. I don't know the long-term effects of having this dust buildup seeping into the keyboard, so unfortunately I will have to find a new carrying case to use.",

Granted I moved from a HDD to this SDD, which probably accounts for a large percentage of the improved speed I notice, but given the modest price, it has lived up to my expectations and beyond.  I will also mention I added 16G Ram to take it to 20G which added a quite a kick, and a second 500G SDD (the drive cady is included in the box), because the one drive on it was only 128G, just not enough for the long haul.  There are videos on youtube for A515-46 install procedures, and one of them points out the screwed down board that has to be loosened to install the drive bus, which was the most helpful advice.  Ram install is no brainer, but only one slot available, the 4G already there is soldered in.  All in all I give it a great rating.",

Too often portable monitors come with somewhat average sized cables making them too thick or rigid for comfortable portable use. The included cable is similar to a Monoprice slim HDMI cable.<br />* Sound is pretty decent for a portable monitor. I have had several small / portable HDMI screens with speakers over the years and this might be the best sounding. Won't blow you away but good in a pinch.<br />* VESA mounting. I prefer to use more, smaller monitors to large traditional monitors for my desktop setup. The ability to mount it even though it has a flexible builtin base is great. However... see below.<br /><br />Minor grips include:<br />* The build quality and how it is represented in the images. The images make it appear metal with beveled corners but it is all plastic. While it helps with weight it does feel more fragile and flimsy when compared to similarly sized metal portable monitors.<br />* The bottom of the monitor where the largest bezel is located is a very thin plastic. Grabbing the monitor there you immediately feel it press into the frame and even a light touch leads to the screen receiving pressure.<br />* VESA mounting is a bit odd. 1) They are using 100mm spacing for the mounting holes rather than the more standard 75mm found in small and light monitors. In my case this turned out to be a slight positive due to my setup but most of the other small monitors I have are using 75mm spacing. 2) They are using non-standard M3 screw sizes. M4 is the norm and as a result I had to search through jars of random screws I have to find ones that would fit. I can understand why they don't include the screws in the box but it certainly would have been nice given they aren't even standard sizes for VESA mounts.<br />* The brightness appears to reset after losing power. I was told it could be due to insufficient power delivery. I'll need to test further.",

Had it working to record through the computer from some security cameras. Here about 2 weeks ago the drive stopped recording and wouldn't let me pull any video up. I did a recover hard drive option and the hard drive worked again but it was loud. VERY LOUD. It sounded like the fingers were dragging on the platters inside the hard drive. I immediately ordered a new hard drive of a completely different style and pulled this one out so I could see about getting it replaced.  Very frustrating because these are supposed to be some very good hard drives. I am trying to contact manufacturer about this problem",

I use it on PC and paired up with a 13900K and 3080 screams in gaming performance. Got over the stated speeds (7100+). I love this drive and will look for SK Hynix products going forward.

An electronic device just thrown around like a book. Nice. In fact, I've ordered books that got better shipping material used. So, I opened it, and lo and behold...it didn't work, thanks to Amazon's wonderful shipping professionalism. I got into contact with Amazon's support, and they ended up transferring me to the manufacturer instead (when it was the Amazon's fault btw), but ensured me that I wouldn't have to pay return shipping. Okay. But, what happens? I go through the long process of talking to the manufacturer, exchange emails, a waste of my time because they end up requiring ME to pay the return shipping when it was the shipping fault to begin with. So, this is what they do, wonderful Amazon. And, this is why I prefer to buy this product $20 more at another store. Next time, I'll skip Amazon, and secure my money into a reliable and professional company. Thanks.",

         "Looks to be a viable airline Underseat backpack. Normally use larger laptop backpacks as can carry more items, but a larger size means either the overhead bin or checked.  This backpack qualifies as an Underseat personal item for most airlines as can pack three days worth of clothes - plus something flat in the rear pocket - and dimensions remain under the 18x14x8 limit.  Obviously if ALL pockets were used simultaneously the material would expand beyond 8 inches, but with care it should fit under the average airline seat.  Only negative is that the main compartment unzips halfway rather than flipping open completely for potential inspections.  Guess the trick would be to pack any Questionable Items - liquids, tweezers, etc - in the TOP half of the bag to make them accessible during security screenings.  And can always cover the logo with black electrical or duct tape.<br /><br />Don't have time for detailed measurements, but it slid into my test box so it's less than 18x14x8 and Good Enough.  For a bit of a size comparison, was able to place three 11x5 paper towel rolls in the main compartment plus a 12x9x.5 box in the rear compartment.  Have seen other products where backpack straps could be completely concealed with a zipper, but straps still count as depth and can live without additional zippers so long as the bag fits.  For what it is worth, also found a personal item suitcase that holds FIVE paper towel rolls instead of three since rigid plastic does not stretch the way cloth does, but this backpack can be used once one gets off the plane while luggage is best left at the hotel.<br /><br />FYI:  The selling page shows the backpack as smooth an unwrinkled while the product itself is actually a little rumpled, but this is great as it doesn't look like there's a briefcase strapped to my back.",

But more than worth the risk due to this simple fact: it is THE best keyboard/cover design around!<br /><br />The way the keyboard attaches at a slight incline, exactly how Microsoft designed the Surface Pro keyboards — along with the perfect snap into place that happens automagically via magnets… it is PERFECT… though, technically, that incline is less healthy for your wrists if you’re seated at a table; but I’m typically reclined in bed when I’m using it, so it’s appreciated! AND you could always detach it and use it completely flat — being bluetooth, it doesn’t need to be attached to work.<br /><br />ALSO — they have NAILED the stand with this model (and taken a clumsy step back with its replacement) — no unstable kickstand to bite into your legs; instead, you have this very sturdy-feeling foot that folds down, providing MUCH more surface area for much greater support.<br /><br />The keys are snappy, feel great to type on. Appreciate the backlighting as well. Another thing that’s apparent after using the 11-in iPad with the Zagg SlimBook Go (which led me to buying this model) — the 12.9 size is noticeably more comfortable in width. Just FYI for anyone on the fence between the two.<br /><br />The detachable cover (always a great feature), despite being a couple of millimeters too small to TRULY fit my 2021 PERFECTLY (and again, it’s not meant to), is an excellent design, with a perfectly functional pencil slot — and the fact the stand is ATTACHED TO THE COVER and travels with it, providing that functionality without the keyboard, is a no-brainer of a design decision that many other keyboard-cover combos are missing.<br /><br />Well done, whoever at Zagg was responsible for creating this masterpiece — so well done, I’m choosing it over newer models meant to replace it!<br /><br />ZAGG — reassess your design decisions, and update this genius design for current and future iPad models, please!!",

It took a number of tries to make everything work and I think that was by accident as I’m not sure if I can repeat what I did.  Not a lot of information on how to make it work as I assume that they figure you would just know how to do it.  Would have liked to have some step by step instructions on how to get stuff off the phone.  There were some instructions included but vague at best.

Coming from a 2012, TN 144 Hz DVI-D based display, this upgrade was more than I could ever imagine. Even on the most extreme overdrive sitting, there is no perceptible inverse ghosting or motion blur, even at lower refresh rates.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ good out of the box color reproduction + 10-bit color profiles<br />+ comes with decent connection cables<br />+ high refresh rate with impeccable motion clarity<br />+ native G-Sync Module provides no tearing, even at the lowest frame rates<br />+ has BFI (Black Frame Insertion) with a wide range, but at the cost of half of the monitor's brightness and only works at 240Hz<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Monitor OSD is very unintuitive, some options seem superfluous and some settings don't stick after power cycling<br />- stand is very large and will not fit on some smaller desks<br />- using the built-in Nvidia reflex latency analyzer can put the monitor into a boot loop sometimes<br />- horrible HDR 400 implementation, makes everything look washed out<br />- despite having two USB ports, there is no KVM switch for each input as seen in other Gigabyte gaming monitors",

This Docking Station carries a three-year warranty with Lenovo. We started to have issues with this docking station losing connection and contacted Lenovo. They were great, and we still had 50 days of warranty on the unit, so a replacement was sent quickly. I registered the product on Lenovo's site with the Dock serial number to extend the warranty to the full three years. Lenovo contacted me and stated, \"This serial number is rooted in Singapore, and the country of the invoice you provided as proof of purchase is the United States of America. For us to update warranty dates, the country of manufacture and the country of the invoice must match.\" So product sold to other areas of the world is being sold to US customers and should not be! Buyer beware. Luckily for us, there were still 50 days on the warranty, and Lenovo sent a replacement. You can find out the remaining warranty if you register the dock on Lenovo's site. Good luck.",

I would suggest that the company put a video of how to put it together, but you should be able to figure it out after a few tries. First put on the hard back the tablet should settle into it. Then put the silicone piece around it, then snap the screen protector over it.",

         "Slower than the oem samsung pm961 Be warned. In the beginning I was getting the full advertised speed around 3000MBs for the 500 gig model. Then I decided to download and install Samsung Magician which is a very good program for Samsung SSD's. As soon as I updated the firmware and tweaked the settings my speeds dropped to barely 2000MBs in all modes, slower than the original nvme I had. To say the least I clean installed windows 11 in an effort to regain the original speed but it never got back to 3000MBs. I can only assume the firmware update changed something. Another possibility is Windows 11. I'm not sure if rolling back the firmware is possible. This was on a Dell XPS 9670 i7.",

I really like that it comes with card readers on the front i/o for both SD and Micro SD even though they take up an extra USB port on the motherboard on top of the extra USB port you need for the USB 2.0 slots that they conveniently added right beside the 1 USB 3.0 slot that needs its own dedicated port.<br /><br />Cable management is a pain.  There's just not enough room behind the right side panel to stow your power cables without making an absolute mess even with a fully modular PSU.  The 3.5 inch drive ports are right behind the power supply port which makes it even worse, and there is no way to remove them without cutting them out.<br /><br />The metal is cheap.  I had a problem plugging my power cable into my SATA SSD due to the metal flange protruding a good half inch below the dedicated mounting location, so I just bent it out of the way with my thumb.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this case is ventilation.  There's about a half inch air gap at the bottom of the front panel which is suppose to feed the front intake fans (not included).  There are two vents on the bottom, one for the PSU and one for the 3.5\" drive bays, but they are both blocked off from the rest of the case by the unremoveable PSU compartment cover, and since I had to run my cables through the drive bays, that one doesn't do much good anyway.  There is one 120 mm vent directly above the CPU with no screw holes to mount a fan.  The air that comes in through that hole is sucked straight back out by the rear 80 mm fan which is included, so it just bypasses all of the hot spots.  The GPU is limited to what air it can pull in from the PCIe ports, so it will just boil and die without some alternate cooling solution, and there's no good way to mount a liquid cooler of any size despite the claims made in the description.<br /><br />All-in-all, this would make a very attractive, low wattage, office dektop, but if you are looking to build a halfway decent gaming PC, look elsewhere unless you just like the convenience of cooking your frozen burritos directly on top of your graphics card.",

         "Great buy! I would have loved to have given this purchase 5/5 stars, but there is one big issue...  Synology's own Knowledge Base/Tutorials are crap, and setting this thing up is NOT intuitive in any measure - not if you want it secure, operating at peak efficiency, and performing everything you need it to.<br /><br />Practically everything I needed to setup - PLEX, Synology Photos, or whatever, was a chore.  Sure, somethings were quite easy to setup, but most things weren't due to lack of information inside the apps, the UI, or Synology's own KB.  I had to resort to watching YouTube videos due to a lack of information from Synology, but more frustrating - a lack of intuitive controls.  I highly urge you to view the videos by SpaceRex, who has an entire series of videos that will prove very helpful - you'll even learn about stuff you were unaware of.<br /><br />Now that I do have it setup the way I want, I'm amazed at all of the options open to me.  I was simply thinking of this as a network storage device that could also serve as my PLEX server and store miscellaneous files.  That alone should have told me that it could act as a server for pretty much anything else.<br /><br />So, am I happy with this purchase - yep, but just a bit frustrated at Synology's own lack of guidance.  I see this as more of an engineer who wrote the help files without letting a non-engineer reinterpret them for normal users scenario - and I'm familiar with setting up servers.  You could argue it is just getting to know the UI, but again, a lot of things simply weren't intuitive...<br /><br />My only other issue...I now wish I'd purchased a 4 bay enclosure to being with.",

    "    *   For each micro-batch of data arriving from the stream:\n",

    "        *   The classified results (review_id, SentimentLabel, SentimentScore) are written to an in-memory table named `live_sentiment_results`. This table updates with each micro-batch.\n",
    "4.  **Output Sink**: The `writeStream` operation uses `format(\"memory\")` and `outputMode(\"append\")` to continuously update the in-memory table. A trigger is set to process data at fixed intervals.\n",
    "5.  **Live Monitoring**: After starting the stream, you can query the `live_sentiment_results` table using SQL in a separate cell to see the results accumulate and update in near real-time.\n",
    "6.  **Simulating New Data**: After the initial chunks are processed, a new CSV file with a single review can be manually added to the `streaming_input_path` to observe the system pick it up and update the table."

    "- Each chunk contains two reviews with different ratings and sentiments to demonstrate varied results.\n",
    "- The files are named `new_single_review_batch_1.csv`, `new_single_review_batch_2.csv`, etc., to avoid overwriting.\n",
